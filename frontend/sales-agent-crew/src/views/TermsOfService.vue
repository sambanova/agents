If Customer is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information, then Customer shall, to the extent legally permitted, provide us with advance written notification and cooperate in any effort to obtain confidential treatment of the Confidential Information. Customer acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such violation by Customer, we will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available at law.
