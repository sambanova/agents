3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Adding New Features

#### Adding a New Route

1. Backend Route:
```python
# backend/api/routes/your_route.py
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/your-endpoint")
async def your_endpoint():
    return {"message": "Your endpoint"}
```

2. Frontend Route:
```javascript
// frontend/sales-agent-crew/src/router/index.js
{
  path: '/your-route',
  name: 'YourRoute',
  component: () => import('@/views/YourView.vue')
}
```

#### Adding a New Agent Type

1. Create a new agent class in `backend/api/agents/`
2. Implement the required interfaces
3. Add the agent to the routing logic
4. Update the frontend to support the new agent type

### Testing

We use the following testing frameworks:

- Backend: pytest
- Frontend: Vitest

```bash
# Run backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend/sales-agent-crew
yarn test
```

#### Writing Tests

1. Backend Tests:
```python
# backend/tests/test_your_feature.py
def test_your_feature():
    # Your test code here
    assert True
```

2. Frontend Tests:
```javascript
// frontend/sales-agent-crew/tests/YourComponent.test.js
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import YourComponent from '@/components/YourComponent.vue'

describe('YourComponent', () => {
  test('renders properly', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(YourComponent)
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Expected text')
  })
})
```

### Git Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and commit using conventional commits:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git commit -m "fix: resolve bug in existing feature"
```

3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the documentation if you're changing functionality
3. The PR must pass all CI/CD checks
4. Get at least one code review from a maintainer
5. Follow the PR template provided

### Documentation

- Use JSDoc for JavaScript/Vue components
- Use docstrings for Python functions
- Update the README.md for major changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic

### Style Guide
