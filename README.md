<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Agents</h1>

The Agents application is an advanced multi-agent AI system that intelligently routes requests to specialized agents and subgraphs for comprehensive assistance. The system features a compound agent architecture with XML-based routing, code execution capabilities, and multi-step research workflows. The Agents application helps users by:

- Providing intelligent assistance through a unified compound agent system.
- Executing code in secure Daytona sandbox environments.
- Performing comprehensive data science workflows with multi-agent collaboration.
- Generating detailed research reports and educational content.
- Conducting advanced financial analysis with real-time data.
- Automatically routing queries to appropriate specialized subgraphs.
- Supporting voice input for natural interaction.

The basic process of the Agents application is described below.

1. **Enhanced agent processing**
   - User submits a query via text or voice input.
   - The compound agent system uses XML-based routing to determine the best approach.
   - Queries are processed through the main agent or routed to specialized subgraphs.

1. **Intelligent subgraph routing**
   - The system automatically determines if queries require specialized subgraph processing.
   - Available subgraphs include: Financial Analysis, Deep Research, Data Science, and Code Execution.
   - Multi-agent collaboration within subgraphs for complex workflows.
   
1. **Tool and data integration**
   - Dynamic tool loading based on user context and permissions.
   - Integration with external APIs, databases, and knowledge sources.
   - Secure code execution and file generation in Daytona sandbox.
   
1. **Real-time response generation**
   - WebSocket-based streaming for real-time updates and agent reasoning.
   - Structured responses with metadata for appropriate UI rendering.
   - File artifacts (PDF, HTML, images, CSV) automatically processed and displayed.

1. **Adaptive user interaction**
   - Frontend intelligence automatically detects agent behaviors and adapts UI.
   - Agent reasoning panel shows real-time thought processes.
   - Continuous learning from interactions to improve future responses.

> **Note**: View the **Agent Reasoning** panel on the right side of the application to see the real-time thought output. The **Daytona Sidebar** automatically opens when code execution is detected.
