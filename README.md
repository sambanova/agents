<h1 style="font-size: 3em;">Agents</h1>

This kit is an example of how a local application can be created, configured and launched to leverage SambaNova's Agents Cloud.  The Agents application routes requests to four different agents: General assistant agent, Sales leads agent, Deep research agent, and a Finance analysis agent. The agents process tens of thousands of tokens that generates lightning fast and accurate results. The Agents application helps sales teams and researchers by:

- Generating qualified sales information with company insights.
- Creating detailed research reports and educational content.
- Intelligently routing queries to the appropriate service.
- Supporting voice input for natural interaction.

The basic process of the Agents application is described below.

1. User query processing
   - User submits a query via text or voice input.
   - The application analyzes the query to determine its category (general assistance, sales leads, research, or financial analysis).

1. Agent assignment
   - The query is routed to the appropriate agent based on content and intent.
   - If the query spans multiple domains, agents collaborate to provide a comprehensive response.
   
1. Data retrieval and processing
   - The selected agent fetches relevant data from available APIs and knowledge bases.
   - AI models process and structure the information for clarity and accuracy.
   
1. Response generation
   - The application generates a structured response.
   - The response is formatted based on the query type (e.g., report format for research, tabular format for financial analysis).

1. User interaction and feedback
   - The user reviews the response and may refine the query.
   - The system continuously learns from interactions to improve future responses.

> **Note**: View the **Agent Reasoning** panel on the right side of the application to see the real-time thought output.

1. Start using the application to enhance sales workflows, conduct research, and gain actionable insights.

## Locally Hosted

### Frontend setup

Follow the steps below to install the frontend for the Agents application.

> **Note**: For the following commands, go to `/frontend/sales-agent-crew/` directory.

1. Install Vue.js dependencies.

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

1. When you have completed the backend setup, you can either:
   + Run a local development environment.

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   + Or, create a production build.

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

### Backend setup

Follow the steps below to install the backend for the Agents application.

> **Note**: For the following commands, go to `/backend/` directory.

1. Install Python dependencies: Create and activate a virtual environment (for example with venv) and install the project dependencies inside it. Make sure to use Python 3.11.

   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Environment variables setup

#### Frontend environment variables

> **Note**: For the frontend environment variables, go to `/frontend/sales-agent-crew/`.

1. Create a `.env` file with the following variables.
   ```bash
   # Clerk Keys
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY="<your_clerk_secret_key>"
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="<your_clerk_publishable_key>"

   # Vite Settings
   VITE_API_URL=/api
   VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8000
   VITE_ENABLE_WORKFLOW_TOGGLE=false
   VITE_ENABLE_USER_KEYS=false
   ```

#### Backend environment variables

> **Note**: For the backend environment variables, go to `/backend/`.
