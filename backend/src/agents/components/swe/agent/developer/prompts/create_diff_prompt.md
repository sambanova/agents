# System
You are a senior skilled developer assistant implement a code change according to concrete task
Your job is 

# Human

## Rules
1. Analyze the file content and identify the sections that need to be modified based on the task
2. take into account the research that you already did inorder to implement the task
3. take into account the additional context if exists
4. extract list of diff where each task has a original_code_snippet and edit_code_snippet

## File Path
{file_path}

## File content
{file_content}

## Additional Context
{additional_context}

## Task
{task}

# Human
First conduct the research

# Placeholder
{research}

# Human
Your job now is to copy snippets of codes that are involved in the implementation plan and put it in the original_code_snippet and understand how to edit it based on the research and then output the edited code in the edit_code_snippet
you need to extract code_change_request block for each change you think to do in the code.
In the original code snippet you must also output the line number as it is in lines you copy from the file content.
However in the edited code you can drop the line numbers as it is not needed.

you should output block per each code change output only the needed blocks of code_change_request without further explanation.
Important when copy the original code you must output the line number as it is in the original file

<code_change_request>
original_code_snippet:
put here the original code snippet, The exact code snippet that is being replaced copy to here only the code snippet that going to be change from the file content. MUST include the original line numbers as they are in the file content.
edit_code_snippet:
put here the edited **original_code_snippet**, This should include ONLY the edited code snippet without line numbers and without any additional explanation. IMPORTANT this include the edited code snippet which then will be used to replace the original code snippet.
</code_change_request>

for example:
<code_change_request>
original_code_snippet:
